/**
* Logback is one of the most popular implementations of SLF4J. It provides the actual implementation for the SLF4J API and allows your application to generate log output.
* It's highly configurable and offers advanced features for logging, like different log levels, log formats, log rotation, and more.
*When you added the Logback implementation as a dependency, it provided the necessary classes and methods for SLF4J to work.
* This allowed Kafka (which uses SLF4J) and other parts of your application to perform logging operations correctly.
*
* In summary, SLF4J provides a consistent logging API for your application and libraries like Kafka, and an implementation like Logback supplies the actual code to handle the logging operations.
* Both are essential for proper logging functionality in your application. Without the SLF4J API and an implementation, you were encountering
* the ClassNotFoundException because the necessary logging classes and methods were missing, causing Kafka and other parts of your application to fail when trying to perform logging operations.
